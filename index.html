      I am currently a senior-year Cinema Studies major at the University of Oregon. Through my education, I have taken courses such as Film, Media, and Culture,
      Intro Narrative Production, Video Art, and other classes. I am learning about film history, theory, and criticism, and basics of film production and post-
      production such as the editing and shooting processes. I also examine related art such as television, music, and videography. I have a particuler insterest
      in video editing and am teaching myself about some editing software such as Adobe Premiere, DaVinci Resolve, and Filmora. I enjoy organizing footage and
      making a story through video editing. I like learning something new, so I started self-teaching about computer graphics, visual effects,
      and programming languages. My experiences as an office assistant developed my ability to cooperate with others, adopt different work environment, and multitasking.
      My future goal is to countribute to create products in media production.
